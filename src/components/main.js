            <h3>“All I have learned, I learned from books.”― Abraham Lincoln.</h3>
            <p>For me all I have learned, I learned from MOOC(Massive Open Online Course) 
              and root cause analysis. I have learned and worked in numerous technologies over the years. One-fifth of a score and many online courses ago, I started off as a web developer learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and went on to work with SAP ERP, SAP ABAP/4, SAP BW, and Python. I love developing single page applications using React.js and writing single line functions using ES6.</p><p>I love watching movies from all over the world, understanding the culture of the country where the movie originated and what made the people become the person they are today. I love the works of Jiří Menzel, Jean-Pierre Melville, Jean Luc Goddard, Askira Kurasowa, David Cronenberg, David Lean among a lot of others. </p>
